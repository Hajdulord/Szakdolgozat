# Thesis

## Theme:

The theme of my Thesis is the use of programming patterns in modern game development. The reasons for this Thesis is to show some patterns to use in moder game development.
Wiht this I will create easily understanable and expandable code. I hold these things important, because I concluded that most of the newly started game dev projects made by rookie game developers fail, because the developers simply don't finish their game. This usually happens, when their code is not planned rather it is ad-hoc. This also usually means that their code is hard to read unstructured and hard to expand. With this mishaps it is easy to see why they don't finish their projects.

The Thesis itself is a 2D metroidvania styled game, where you need to dodge obstacles and fight enemys to reach the end gole. For this I will use the Unity engine, where I will create component based scripts in C#.
